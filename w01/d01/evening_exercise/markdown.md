## Markdowns and READMEs

Popular repositories on GitHub often have a jazzy introduction to their project that shows right on their GitHub project's main page.

They accomplish this by including a ```README.md``` file in their repo written in a language called Markdown.

Check out some examples:
  - [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
  - [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
  - [ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay)

### Previewing Markdown in Atom
