# Week 1 Assessment

Please work alone. Feel free to use tools like the Chrome Console or Repl.it to test your code.

This assessment consists of short answer & code questions, all based on the YouTube JavaScript videos you watched before class. To do the code challenge portion. Please write your answers to the short answer questions into this markdown. If you write/test your code in Repl.it or the Chrome Console, copy and paste each step of your code, as well as your answers, into this markdown too.

Once finished, go ahead and attach the markdown to an email and send it to all of us, your instructional team (listed below)! :sparkles:

### Code questions

1. Assign one variable to hold your name and one variable to hold the name of your favorite lunch spot. Write an expression using that variable that tells everyone your favorite place for lunch.

  e.g. `Hi my name is Ash. My favorite place for lunch is Chipotle.`

2. Complete the following steps:
  * Create a new function called `myMessage`.
  * When executed, have the function log the message `"This function was executed!"`.
  * Additionally, have it return `true`.
  * Store the returned value of `myMessage` in a new variable called `newVariable`.

3. Write a while loop that iterates over the given array, removing the last element in the array through each iteration. Log the result of thisArray each time it loops through. When thisArray is empty, the while loop should stop.

  `var thisArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`

4. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.
