## JavaScript Drills!

Tonight you are going to write JavaScript statements to solve the following problems. This assignment is to get you to started thinking like a developer.

A starter HTML file has been provided and is where you should work tonight.

#### 1. Pythagorean Theorem
Write a JavaScript statement that can solve the pythagorean theorem.
Don't know it? Google might! :smile:

#### 2. Create an array of your favorite things
Create an array that will have 5 indices—**0 through 4**. Each one should be assigned a value that contains a favorite thing of yours.

#### 3. Write a statement that checks to see if a buyer is over 21
We want to sell the booze! However, we can't sell to minors. Write an **if/else** statement that checks someone's age to be over 21. :beer:

#### 4. Problems...problems everywhere!
Take the following math statements and turn them into JavaScript statements. *Use variables where they make sense.*

- Item A is greater than Item B
- Item C is equal to Item D
- 42 is less than 48
- Name is equal to Name
- Item E minus Item F equals Item G
- Item H squared equals Item I
- Item J times Item H

#### 5. Adventure Time!
- Write an adventure story in a paragraph.
- Next, you'll need to remove key verbs and nouns. Your users will enter their own values for these (like MadLibs).
- For example: _Today, I was [  x  ] to [  y  ]! On my way, I encountered [  z  ]! I had to use my [  u  ] to escape the horrible clutches of [  q  ]! All in a day's work as a [  k  ]!_
- You must use `prompt()` to ask your users at least five questions. These questions will determine the words used in your story. These answers should be assigned to a variable.
  - *Bonus*: Use an `array` to store your user's input.
- You will then need to use string manipulation to build your adventure paragraph!
- You should use at least one **conditional statement** when building your adventure.
- Try your (or a classmate's) adventure story out!

### Done?
As we did yesterday, please submit your evening assignment via a GitHub issue. In the body of your submission, make sure to leave your **comfortability** (0–5), **completeness** (0–5), a **win**, a **challenge** and maybe a **comment** about this assignment.
