## Is it hot in here or is it just me? :snowflake: :fire: :snowflake: :fire:

It's starting to get nice outside! As it starts to heat up out there, we need to make sure out thermostat is working correctly. Let's use JAVASCRIPT to make sure it is!

### Conditional Air Conditioner
Using comparative operators and conditional statements create an air conditioner program.

* Use the starter HTML file provided: `air_conditioner_starter.html`. Once we've completed the steps below, you can test whether your program works by opening this file in Chrome.
* To start, your program should prompt the user for the current temperature, then prompt the user a second time for the temperature they would like it to be.
* If the desired temperature is more than the current temperature, print the following statement to the console: `Turning off the A/C! It's too cold!`.
* If the desired temperature is less than the current temperature, print the following statement to the console: `Turning on the A/C! It's boiling in here!`.
* Otherwise, if the temperatures are the same, print the following statement to the console: `A perfect temperature. Keep the cool!`.

### Temperature Converter
Now that our air conditioner works, let's keep thinking about temperature.

* As before, use the starter HTML file: `temp_converter_starter.html`.
* Prompt the user for two inputs: a temperature, and a temperature scale they would like to convert that temperature to.
* The options for temperature scales should be: `F to C` or `C to F`
* If a user selects `C to F` then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Celsius, and should therfore be converted to the Fahrenheit temperature.
* If a user selects `F to C` then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Fahrenheit, and should therefore be converted to the Celsius temperature.
* Use console.log to print the results of each calculation to the console.

## Stay Cool!
