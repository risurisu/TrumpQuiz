# WEEKEND ONE!!!

Guys! You did it! Congrats on soaring through week one of WDI!:sparkles::sparkles:

This weekend, we have two assignments for you that will give some practice working with JavaScript and the DOM.

### MTA

Based on the video that Andrew recorded today (Friday) and the MTA program that you built Thursday night, please make your own MTA application that renders the different train stops for each line.

Create a new directory inside of the `evening_exercise`  that is called `train_display`. Include all of the needed files within that directory.

### LOTR

In this evening exercise folder, there is another folder called `evening_exercise/LOTR`. Inside, are all kinds of files, as well as a `README.md` that has all of the directions you will need to complete this assignment!
