#iPod Classic

Let's draw an iPod Classic using HTML/CSS! Please work with a partner!

###Step 1 (Command Line)

* Navigate to your `w01/d04/morning_exercise` directory in our `WDI_WODR_OTTER` repository.
* Make a directory there called `css_ipod` and navigate into this directory.
* Make an HTML file called `index.html`.
* Make a CSS file called `style.css`.
* Open these files in your text editor.  
* Open `index.html` in Chrome.

###Step 2 (File Structure)

* Setup your `index.html` boilerplate. Please type this into your file (NO COPY AND PASTE!!!!):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CSS iPod!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

###Step 3 (Draw an iPod OG!)

Some pointers/pro-tips/resources:

* How do you make a cirlce in CSS?
```css
#wheel {
	border-radius: 50%;
}
```

* Break down the example iPod picture in terms of its visual components.
* Think about how to lay these components within/on top of each other.

* [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Examples)

###Step 4 (Make it your iPod!)

* Change the screen content to have a sweet image/GIF.
* iPod's used to be in many wacky colors!
* Use borders to make it have a more 3-D look/feel.
