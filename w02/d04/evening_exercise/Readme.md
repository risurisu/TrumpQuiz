# Color Sliders!!!

- Using jQuery, allow your users to FIND the color they love by sliding RED, GREEN, and BLUE sliders.
- You will be using the `rbg()` format for color
  - In this format, the first value is your red value, second value is your green value, and third value is your blue value.  
  - For example: `rgb(255,0,2)` would be 255 of red, 0 of green, and 2 of blue
- The sliders... will tell you how much red, green, and blue there should be between 0 and 255

- We will use HTML sliders for each color:
  - You'll need to research what event is fired when a color slider has a `change`
  - Check out this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets#Sliders) to learn more about HTML sliders


- **BEFORE YOU BEGIN**, open up the HTML file and add comments to explain what is happening on each line. (You might want to go to that link above to learn more about setting up sliders! )

- **ONCE YOU COMPLETE** the JS, please add comments to your code to explain what is happening on each line.

### Hints!
- The below line would set the background color to
  - 200 of red
  - 150 of green
  - 11 of blue

`$('#body').css("background-color") = 'rgb(' + 200 + ',' + 150 + ',' + 11 + ')';`
