# ToDo Version 1 !!!!

To-Do list are **VERY** common in the world of development. When you are learning new technologies and adding new skills, using the things you learn to in this context is really useful.

Tonight, we're going to use what we have been learning about jQuery to build a To-Do list application where we can:

  - Add tasks that we want to keep track of with an input form
  - Have those task appear on the screen when you hit submit

Feel free to use the video our pal Andrew recorded today as reference!

### BONUS SECTION.

**IF** your application is able to add items to the to-do list, why not try adding a few more features.  Some ideas are:

  - Impliment a **Delete** functionality that allows a user to remove a task from the list
  - Refactor your code so that you can make multiple different lists and add tasks to each of those separate lists.
