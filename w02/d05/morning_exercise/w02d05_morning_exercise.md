# OWL KINDS OF EVENTS!

**What**<br>
We will be setting a number of event listeners to an element of the DOM

**Why**<br>
Events are an important way of letting the end-user interact with an HTML document

**How**<br>
There is a boilerplate html document and css file that renders a little owl on the screen. The prompts will have you set a number of event listeners to manipulate this owl.

### Prompts

Using JavaScript, add the following event listeners and actions so that when the...

**Mouse moves over the owl,**
  * The background of the body changes to a random color

**Mouse leaves the owl,**
  * The background of the body changes back to its original state

**Mouse click on the owl,**
  * An alert window pops up warning the user, `do not poke the owl`

**Arrow keys are pressed,**
  * The Owl moves in direction of arrow key pressed

**Enter key is pressed,**
  * The Owl doubles in size

**"S" key is pressed**
  * The Owl halves in size


_Hint_ When doing math of any kind... ALWAYS make sure you are working with integers :)

##### Bonus:
  Create a timeout that removes the owl after 10 seconds unless a certain key is pressed first.
