# HTML & CSS Reps!

Based on the mockups provided, help these companies style their dream websites!

### Brook&Lyn :dancers:

* The trendy clothing brand Brook&Lyn needs a new website and has asked you to build it for them!
* In the `brook_and_lyn_starter` folder, a designer provided a file called `mockup.png` as your visual guide. Luckily, they are a cool client and allow for some "creative freedom." Don't worry if it's not a perfect match!
* The client has provided the assets you'll need to build their site including images and stylesheets.
* Write your HTML in `index.html` and your CSS in `style.css`.
* You **DO NOT** need to change anything in `normalize.css` or `reset.css`!!!

### eCardly :love_letter:

* eCardly also needs a new website! But one of the devs on the engineering team already built out the HTML for you. How nice of him.
* Your job is to use the `screenshot-final.png` to deliver the client a beautiful website.
* Look at the provided `index.html` in the `starter_ecardly` folder and use that as a guide to target the elements you want to style.
* Work in `style.css` in the `starter_ecardly` folder.
* Make your CSS changes to `style.css` in the area between **Base Style** and **Layout**.
* You do not need to change anything in `normalize.css`!!!
* Here are some tips to get you started:

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the `background.jpg` provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of `#d6d6d6`. (Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line).

* The `<body>` has a default font of `Helvetica` with font size of `12px`.

* Define a line height for the body of `1.7`. This gives every line of text `.35` padding above and below it.

### Links (`<a>` tags)

* Links on the page should be red (`#ff3300`) and not be underlined.

### Header Picture

* The `<h1>` tag with the `<a>` tag inside of it should not be text but an image.

* Set the background of the `<a>` tag within an `<h1>` to the `logo.png`.

* Size its height and width appropriately to fit the full logo.

* Have it display `block`. This will have this tag appear on its own line. (It is how we can make it appear here).

* Center it.

### `<h2>` + `<a>` tags

* `<h2>`'s should have a font of 20px.  Also they should have a top and bottom margin of 10px, and no left and right margin.

* links (`<a>` tags) inside of `<h2>`'s should be black and should not be underlined.
