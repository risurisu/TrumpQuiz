Included in your starter folder, please find a `.png` file of what our website is supposed to look like.  Also, included is an `index.html` and the necessary assets and stylesheets needed to make our page.  Here are some steps to get you started.

NOTE: Please make your CSS changes to `style.css` in the area between **Base Style** and **Layout**.  

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in images.  The image should repeat only going left and right.  The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6. (Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line).

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

### Links (`<a>` tags)

* Links on the page should be red (#ff3300) and not be underlined.

### Header Picture

* The `<h1>` tag with the `<a>` tag inside of it should not be text but an image.

* Please remove the text from the html.

* Set the background of the `<a>` tag within an `<h1>` to the logo.png.

* Size it's height and width appropriately to fit the full logo.

* Have it display block.  This will have this tag appear on it's on line.  (It is how we can make it appear here).

* Center it.  

### `<h2>` + `<a>` tags

* `<h2>`'s should have a font of 20px.  Also they should have a top and bottom margin of 10px, and no left and right margin.

* links (`<a>` tags) inside of `<h2>`'s should be black and should not be underlined.
