I decided to take a simple approach and use an array with conditionals to build a
quote trivia game.

My original idea was to have five characters that rotated through each "round", but
I ended up biting off more than I can do so I scaled back and used just one character
to make sure I had a finished project that worked.

In the future, I would like to include those with images that pop up reacting to the
users answer as well as snappier CSS, but overall I'm happy with this finished product.
